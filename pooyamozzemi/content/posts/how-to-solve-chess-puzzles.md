Have you ever seen a chess puzzle in a position you don't know what to do or where to start thinking 
about it? or you select a move and you think this was the best move and then see it was wrong? Here,
I try to introduce a systematic way to analyze chess puzzles and solve them. This can be used as a
framework so right after you see the position you know exactly where to start and check for alternative
solutions.

Disclaimer: This framework works pretty well to achieve puzzle ratings aound 2400-2800 on chess.com
puzzles. As I improve my rating and discover new ideas and extend the framework I update this post.
