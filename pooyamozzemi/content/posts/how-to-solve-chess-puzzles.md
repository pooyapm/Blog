Have you ever seen a chess puzzle in a position you don't know what to do or where to start thinking 
about it? or you select a move and you think this was the best move and then see it was wrong? Here,
I try to introduce a systematic way to analyze chess puzzles and solve them. This can be used as a
framework so right after you see the position you know exactly where to start and check for alternative
solutions.

Disclaimer: This framework works pretty well to achieve puzzle ratings aound 2400-2800 on chess.com
puzzles. As I improve my rating and discover new ideas and extend the framework I update this post.

use small patterns to build larger patterns

Hook
Overview of problem solving
Pattern recognition beings
Working memory capacity and its role in problem solving, so patterns are important
Known patterns 
First objective, experience from known patterns helps you here to identify the patterns
Helps to identify small patterns
Importance of the learning process on the side
Check for small patterns
Look for weaknesses
Same row
Same column
Unprotected
Less supported pieces
Forks
Trapped
Look for supported 
Squares
Columns
Rows
Diagonals
Combine the moves to come up with a bigger pattern
How after one move opponent will defend
Which is supported
Squares
Columns
Rows
Diagonals
Pieces
When move to a new position
What is supported
New small patterns from new positions  
Rearrange the moves

Example must:
Different possible objectives
One objective must not work
Learning must help to guess possible small patterns
Different small patterns
Weakness must help to identify small pattern 
One arrange must be defended
Second arrange can work
One picture of all working togther
