***Hello,*** 

This is Pooya. In this blog, I write my thoughts on different topics from technology to critical skills necessary for todayâ€™s world, business, leadership, management, psychology, economy and even geopolitical trends which may impact the macroeconomic environment and business sectors and corporations. 

Whenever I have failed at something in life or improved something I tried to develop a framework or process for it to improve and here, I am sharing it with you.

**I believe in lifelong learning.** 

Intelligence is in simplicity.

I like to explain everything in the most simple form possible.

I am interested in developing concepts, processes, frameworks and theorization of almost everything! The concepts and frameworks I introduce here are mainly those which I have personally developed over the course of my life. I believe just being aware of these concepts must be helpful for some people, so I share it with you here. 

I would also like to explain difficult concepts in a simple way which even people who do not have much related background can understand. I try to employ this approach in all of my posts.

**Education background:**
- M.BA Master of Business Administration
- M.Sc. In Computer, communications and information technology - Signal Processing
- B.Sc. In Electrical engineering (Telecommunication)
- B.Sc in Mathematics

**Disclaimer:** Most of what I write here are just my personal thoughts on various topics. Any use of these concepts, principles and frameworks is of course but with your own responsibility and caution.
